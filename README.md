## 1. Terraform Setup

**Objective**: Use Terraform to provision the required cloud infrastructure.

### Steps
1. Initialize the Terraform configuration.
2. Run a plan to review resources that will be created.
3. Apply the configuration to deploy infrastructure.

Ensure that Terraform has access to cloud provider credentials and is correctly configured.

## 2. Kubespray Installation and Additional Tools

**Objective**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster with Kubespray, along with Longhorn, NGINX Ingress Controller, MetalLB, and Argo CD.

### Steps
1. **Kubespray Setup**:
   - Clone the Kubespray repository and install dependencies.
   - Prepare an inventory file for your cluster nodes.
   - Deploy the Kubernetes cluster using the Ansible playbook provided by Kubespray.

2. **Longhorn**:
   - Install Longhorn for distributed block storage within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Follow Longhornâ€™s installation guide to enable persistent storage for applications.

3. **NGINX Ingress Controller**:
   - Deploy the NGINX Ingress Controller to manage HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services in the cluster.
   - Configure ingress resources to expose applications securely and manage routes.

4. **MetalLB**:
   - Install MetalLB to provide load-balancing capabilities within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Configure IP ranges in MetalLB for services that require external IPs.

5. **Argo CD**:
   - Deploy Argo CD for continuous deployment and GitOps management.
   - Configure Argo CD to connect to your Git repository and manage applications in the cluster.

Kubespray and the additional tools enable a robust Kubernetes environment, with persistent storage, traffic routing, load balancing, and GitOps-driven deployment.

## 3. Prometheus Stack Deployment with Argo CD

**Objective**: Deploy Prometheus Stack Operator using Argo CD for monitoring the Kubernetes environment.

### Steps
1. Add the Prometheus Operator repository in Argo CD.
2. Define an Argo CD application targeting the Prometheus Stack deployment.
3. Sync the application to install Prometheus in the Kubernetes cluster.

Argo CD will ensure that Prometheus Stack is deployed and maintained for monitoring and alerting.

## 4. PostgreSQL Cluster Setup with Operator

**Objective**: Deploy a PostgreSQL cluster using the PostgreSQL Operator.

### Steps
1. Install the PostgreSQL Operator on your Kubernetes cluster.
2. Define a manifest for the PostgreSQL cluster, specifying databases, users, and access configurations.
3. Apply the manifest to deploy the PostgreSQL cluster.

The operator will manage the PostgreSQL setup, including backup, scaling, and updates.

## 5. CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Argo CD for FastAPI

**Objective**: Automate the CI/CD pipeline for deploying a FastAPI application using GitHub Actions and Argo CD.

### Steps
1. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to build, test, and deploy the FastAPI application.
2. Configure Argo CD to manage the FastAPI deployment in the Kubernetes cluster.
3. Push changes to trigger GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

With GitHub Actions handling the CI/CD pipeline and Argo CD for deployment synchronization, changes to the FastAPI codebase are automatically tested and deployed.

This setup provides a comprehensive deployment pipeline, integrating Terraform, Kubernetes, Argo CD, and GitHub Actions to manage infrastructure and application deployments.
